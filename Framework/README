All files are located in Framework. use

python Framework/new_main.py 

to run all the experiments and plotting, 
set the folder names in config to where you want to save the results.

All the config is in new_config.
1. to pre-train student:
student_bool: True
teacher_bool: False
teacher_student_bool: False
active: True
pt: True

2. to pre-train teacher:
student_bool: False
teacher_bool: True
teacher_student_bool: False
active: True
pt: True

3. to fine-tune student
student_bool: True
teacher_bool: True
teacher_student_bool: True
pt: False

Plot graphs indicate whether you are plotting or running a simulation.
If plot_graph = True, you need to change the names and labels in the new_main script for which data to plot.

public_noise indicates if you are adding the spam dataset into the sentiment dataset, set it true when you want noise in the public set.
If it's set to False, the model will only train on the sentiment set

when half = True, then in the public set sentiment:spam = 1:1
when half = False, then in the public set sentiment:spam = 4:1

Ignore the following variables, they are no longer relevant
input_embeding_size, hidden_size, embed_size
